The audience actively participates in Steve's daily routine and helps solve everyday problems, all within a context of entertaining games and activities. Blue's Clues is designed to develop preschoolers' thinking, reasoning and social skills through an educational approach called \"flexible thinking,\" a theory that recognizes that children need to learn, not just what to think, but how to think for themselves. Blue's Clues uses a play-along format, which encourages kids to actively participate in using the clues as they view the program."

These principled kids tackle the really important issues facing their peers, like the right to stay up late or to eat whatever they want. But when taking a stand is just not enough, this crew embarks on top secret missions on behalf of children everywhere, utilizing fantastic homemade technology like flying machines and catapults, to accomplish their goals. Like any good team, the agents in Codename: Kids Next Door each have their own distinct identities, skills and personalities. Numbuh One is Nigel Uno, the British-accented leader of the group. Hoagie P. Gilliam, a mechanical genius and expert pilot, is known as Numbuh Two. Diversionary tactics are the specialty of Kiki Sanban, also known as Numbuh Three. Brash and impulsive Numbuh Four (Wallabee Beatles) is a master of hand to hand combat. And Numbuh Five, alias Abigail \"Abby\" Lincoln, is the quiet one with the most common sense. Whether it's the possibility of getting shipped off to summer camp, battling the imposition of adult swim time at the local swimming pool, or clashing with adult enemies such as Gramma Stuffum, Knightbrace, Mr. Wink and Mr. Fibb, these kids have their work cut out for them."

When the dastardly villain Hacker (played deliciously by Christopher Lloyd) launches a mad mission to conquer the virtual universe, Motherboard calls upon three Earth kids for help. They are Jackie, Matt and Inez - the heroes of CYBERCHASE - who travel from their real-world realm, along with the wise-cracking cyber-bird Digit (comic actor Gilbert Gottfried), to the colorful virtual vistas of cyberspace where they vanquish the bad guys in an all-out battle of wits. Each episode takes the kids on a thrilling adventure driven by a different math concept - from tackling time in ancient Egyptian tombs, to cracking codes in creepy caves, or making sense of numbers in a fractured fairy tale world. In their quest, the heroes use minds, not muscles, to overcome obstacles and danger everywhere. Every episode of CYBERCHASE concludes with a \"For Real\" live action segment in which a young comic actor encounters a situation which reinforces the math concept explored in the animated story line."

The program shows two warm, caring people taking the time to be with one child. They address the child directly and personally. Into this relationship are woven the stories, songs and activities that form the fabric of Australian children's culture. Play School is successful because it satisfies our basic human need to interact with other people and to be valued by them. Play School aims to extend the child's interest and it encourages participation. Each program contains a story, some songs (both traditional and new) and a variety of play ideas with things to make and do. Each week has a theme which is developed in different ways depending on the day. The daily format usually includes the Clock and a look outside Play School via the Windows. More recently the Play School projector is also used for a mindfulness segment asking viewers to stop, look and listen."

    "description": "Pocoyo is a curious toddler dressed all in blue, from his blue cap to his blue jumpsuit. He's full of fun and perhaps a touch of good-natured mischief. His friends include Pato, the yellow duck; Elly, the pink elephant with a blue backpack; Loula, his faithful dog; Sleepy Bird, the droopy-eyed blue-green bird always asleep in her nest; and many others. The Narrator greets little Pocoyo every day and gently suggests an answer to anything that puzzles him. But just as often, the Narrator himself learns something valuable. Pocoyo's computer-animated world is full of simple shapes, bright colors and cheerful music."

She has many adventures with her siblings, her friend Fufu (a bat), and the local village cats who don't live as luxuriously as her and her family."

Instead of taking the logical approach to everyday challenges, SpongeBob approaches life in a wayward and unconventional way.

They meet up with an inventor named Newton Gimmick who accompanies them on their quest for the Treasure of Grundo. What the Trio unexpectedly find are six crystals with different meanings and powers. These crystals, however, also can enable the Monsters and Villains Organization (MAVO) to have absolute power over the land, and the leader, Quellor, wants to make sure that an Illiop never possesses the crystals. Elsewhere, a less pronounced threat also routinely besieges the Trio, which is the wannabe villain Jack W. Tweeg, a greedy Troll-half Grunge who has huge hopes for joining MAVO. The sixty five episode series, based upon the tape-and-book toy bear Teddy Ruxpin, unfolds gradually, as the Trio meet up with more and more interesting and often friendly creatures and visit intriguing lands."

Here, T&amp;J, after years of rivalry, have become the best of friends (and Jerry dons a red bow tie, so the animators would be able to \"fragment\" his movements), in episodes wherein they roamed the world competing in sports, enduring on-the-job misadventures, running afoul of dastardly villains, solving mysteries and helping others. In the first season, three 7-minute New Tom &amp; Jerry segments alternated with two 10-minute ones concerning a 40-foot purple ape, Grape Ape (voiced by Bob Holt) and his fast-talking beagle buddy, a carnival hustler answering to the unlikely moniker of Beegle Beagle (voiced by Marty Ingels), or \"Beegley Beagley,\" as G.A. would lovingly refer to him. The second season ushered in 16 6-minute segments of The Mumbly Cartoon Show, a new Hanna-Barbera comedy/mystery concerning a snickering plainclothes man detective hound named Lt. Mumbly (voiced by the late Don Messick and patterned loosely after Muttley of Wacky Races [CBS, 1968-70] and Dastardly And Muttley In Their Flying Machines [CBS, 1969-71] fame) and his schlocky stooge, Shnooker (voiced by John Stephenson)."
