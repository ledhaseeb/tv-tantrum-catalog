The researchers compared four scenarios:

', 'The findings revealed that children learned best when they had direct interaction with physical objects (3D learning). Among the 2D media scenarios, those involving active parental support (both JME conditions) led to better learning outcomes compared to passive viewing. This suggests that while direct, hands-on experiences are most effective for learning at this age, engaging with 2D media can also be beneficial, especially when parents actively participate and provide guidance.

In summary: 

For 2-year-old children, direct interaction with real objects facilitates the most effective learning. However, when engaging with 2D media, active parental involvement enhances learning outcomes compared to passive viewing.', 'Frontiers in Psychology', '2021-01-21', 'Fri May 23 2025 14:57:55 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)', 'Learning Outcomes', '/research/1748012164444-output(1).png', 'Sat May 24 2025 10:43:30 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.576940/full#h12', '2-Y/O Learning: Joint Media vs. Passive Viewing', 'Learning From 2D Media With and Without Parental Support:  Comparing Two Forms of Joint Media Engagement With Passive Viewing and Learning From 3D.', 'Passive Viewing:

Population: The research analyzed data from 437 children participating in a birth cohort study. Published in 2023 and citing 51 references.



Assessment Methods: Screen time was reported by parents during infancy. EEG measurements were taken to assess brain activity patterns, and cognitive functions were evaluated at 9 years of age using standardized tests.

Implications:

The findings suggest that excessive screen time in infancy may influence brain development, leading to cognitive challenges later in childhood. Parents and caregivers should be mindful of the amount of screen exposure during early developmental stages and consider engaging infants in activities that promote healthy brain development.', 'Jama Pediatrics', '2023-01-30', 'Sat May 24 2025 11:18:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)', 'Cognitive Development', '/research/1748085447290-output(3).png', 'Sat May 24 2025 11:18:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2800776', 'Infant Screen Use Decreasing Executive Function', 'Associations Between Infant Screen Use, Electroencephalography Markers, and Cognitive Outcomes', 'The study titled "Associations Between Infant Screen Use, Electroencephalography Markers, and Cognitive Outcomes" examines the relationship between screen time in infancy, brain activity patterns, and cognitive development in later childhood.





Increased Screen Time Linked to Cognitive Impairments: 
Infants with higher daily screen time exhibited altered brain activity patterns, specifically increased theta/beta ratios in frontocentral and parietal regions, which were associated with poorer executive function at 9 years of age.



Mediating Role of Brain Activity: The study suggests that the relationship between early screen exposure and later cognitive outcomes is mediated by these specific electroencephalography (EEG) markers.
