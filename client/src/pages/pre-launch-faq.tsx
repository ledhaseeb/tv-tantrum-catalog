              TV Tantrum is a platform that analyzes children's TV shows based on their sensory impact. 
              We provide detailed information about elements like animation style, scene frequency, music tempo, 
              dialogue intensity, and overall stimulation level to help parents make informed decisions about 
              what their children watch.

              What is a "stimulation score"?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className="text-lg">
              A stimulation score is our proprietary rating that measures how stimulating a show is for a child's 
              developing brain. Shows with higher scores contain more fast-paced scenes, louder sound effects, 
              and more intense visual elements. This score helps parents find content that matches their child's 
              sensory preferences and needs.
