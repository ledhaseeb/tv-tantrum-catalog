          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            TV Tantrum was created with a simple mission: to help parents and caregivers 
            make informed decisions about the children's TV shows their little ones watch. 
            We believe that understanding the sensory and developmental impact of media is 
            crucial for creating a balanced and healthy viewing experience.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional content rating systems that focus primarily on age-appropriateness 
            and content warnings, TV Tantrum analyzes shows based on their sensory impact - 
            elements like animation style, scene frequency, music tempo, dialogue intensity, 
            and overall stimulation level. These factors can significantly affect how children 
            process and respond to media.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            TV Tantrum began when a group of parents, child development specialists, and media 
            experts came together with a shared concern: the lack of detailed information about 
            how children's shows affect developing minds. After countless hours of research, 
            analysis, and testing with real families, we built a platform that gives parents 
            the insights they need to make media choices aligned with their child's unique 
            sensory profile.
