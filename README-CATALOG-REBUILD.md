# TV Tantrum Catalog Version - Complete Rebuild Plan

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive plan and implementation for your TV Tantrum catalog rebuild. This version maintains your exact design system while removing social features and focusing on core content discovery.

## Design System Preservation

**âœ… Maintained Elements:**
- **Color Palette**: Teal blue primary (#285161), yellow/gold secondary (#F6CB59), green accent
- **Typography**: Nunito for headings, Open Sans for body text
- **Component Library**: All existing shadcn/ui components
- **Layout Structure**: Current navbar, footer, grid systems
- **Filtering System**: Complete age range sliders, stimulation score filters, theme selection
- **Visual Cards**: Same ShowCard design and layout

## React Implementation Strategy

**Pages Included:**
1. **Home Page** (`catalog-home.tsx`) - Featured content discovery
2. **Browse Page** (existing `browse.tsx`) - Full filtering capabilities 
3. **Compare Page** (existing `compare.tsx`) - Side-by-side comparison
4. **About Page** (existing `about.tsx`) - Platform information
5. **Research Page** (existing `research.tsx`) - Read-only research summaries
6. **Admin Panel** (existing `admin-page.tsx`) - Content management

**Components Preserved:**
- `ShowFilters.tsx` - Complete filtering interface with sliders
- `ShowCard.tsx` - Existing show display cards

## Database Architecture

**Simplified Schema** (`catalog-schema.ts`):
