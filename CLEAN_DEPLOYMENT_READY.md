# TV Tantrum - Clean Production Deployment

## Project Optimized for Railway

**Size:** 100MB (down from 320MB)
**Files:** 459 source files (essential code only)
**TV Shows:** All 302 shows preserved

## Ready for GitHub Upload

### Essential Directories Only:
- `client/` - React frontend (optimized)
- `server/` - Express backend with all APIs
- `shared/` - TypeScript schemas
- `public/` - Essential static assets only

### Production Files:
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment config
- `Dockerfile` - Container setup
- `README.md` - Deployment guide

### Removed Unnecessary Files:
- Development screenshots (218MB)
- Duplicate TV show images
- Local database files
- Temporary scripts and guides
- Image optimization tools

## GitHub Upload Strategy

**Small enough for easy upload:**
- Can upload entire project at once
- Or split into 4-5 logical batches
- All dependencies managed by Railway

Your project is now deployment-ready with no bloat.
